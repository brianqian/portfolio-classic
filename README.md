# Portfolio Page

Hi welcome to my portfolio page. I'm a web developer based in Brooklyn, New York looking for my first professional job as a web developer. I started coding at a bootcamp in July of 2018 and I've been self-taught since. After the bootcamp led us to React, I learned to teach myself other relevant technologies after such as

- Redux
- styled-components
- Jest/Enzyme
- Typescript
- Webpack
- Babel
