# Portfolio Page

Hi welcome to my portfolio page. I'm a web developer based in Brooklyn, New York looking for my first professional job as a web developer. I started coding at a bootcamp in July of 2018 and I've been self-taught since. After the bootcamp led us to React, I learned to teach myself other relevant technologies after such as:

- Redux
- styled-components
- Jest/Enzyme
- Typescript
- Webpack
- Babel

Take a look at my deployed site here: https://brianqian.com

## New things learned

- Intersection Observer API to trigger scroll animations and change navbar color on scroll
- Using 56.25% padding on an outside container to retain a 16:9 aspect ratio on the hero image
- Img srcset for hero image to render different quality images for different resolutions
